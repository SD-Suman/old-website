title: R and Python in fresh Linux install

Installing R Studio, setting up Anaconda and your environments in a fresh Linux install.


I recently did a fresh install of linux for the nth time. Remember to always backup your precious files! History of my linux use is, as predictable, a slow Windows 7 PC. Now I cannot imagine going back to Windows anymore.


Linux Mint Cinnamon ---> Linux Mint MATE ---> MX Linux Fluxbox 

Here I followed the natural transition from a full fleged Linux distro with huge games and office included to lighter one (MATE) and now to one of the lightest Fluxbox. Fluxbox doesn't come with any junk apps and doesn't even care about basic customization - a total no nonsense, light, fast OS. I recommend following a similar transition to get to know the operations and to ease into Linux if you are coming from Windows - you gradually even pick up a lot of basic terminal coding along the way. The downside of a new OS, however, is how much time it takes to get back all your packages so your old codes work perfectly fine.


Here I list out the first steps to get your Linux system up and running quickly as I have had to replicate most of these process in the n fresh installs I have done so far.
