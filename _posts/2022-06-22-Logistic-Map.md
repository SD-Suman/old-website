A simple equation with complex outcomes

My curiousity about complex systems and its applciation in finding solutions for the intrinsical complexity that is urban (social and resource utilization) systems led me to this beautiful equation. 

The equation is simply:

What makes this simple equation behave stocastically and creates a bifurcation graph, which after some time in running (for a time tn) produces a value for t by taking feedback from t-1 (the previous) step. A helpful way of picturing this equation is through a population growth scenario of a settlement which grows from nothing to a thriving metropolis, where the growth rate includes floating population of tourists, short term residents and marginal workers who come in for a few specific months to earn their living. The stocasticity over a period of time could be nicely explained by this.
