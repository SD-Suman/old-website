A simple equation with complex outcomes

My curiousity about complex systems and its applciation in finding solutions for the intrinsical complexity that is urban (social and resource utilization) systems led me to this beautiful equation. 

The equation is simply:

What makes this simple equation behave stocastically and create a bifurcation graph which after some time in running (for a time tn) is the feedback it takes from t-1 step.
