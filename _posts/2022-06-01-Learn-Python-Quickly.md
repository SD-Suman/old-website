All you need to know to learn Python quickly: all the basics.

I learnt python by first jumping into two complicated packages (OSMNX and NetworkX). Some things you learn as you go: Linux, LaTeX, NetLogo, Octave, Git/Github. But for some, you cannot start without a complete set of basics, else risk getting stuck at it for too long and end up procrastinating. This holds true for Data Science and Complex Systems (will post on this soon!): You can only gain mastery in python (or R) quickly by doing a project in it, but you still need to know the basic python to be able to handle any data that you have. Data Science is an ocean! You learn a ton, forget some, adapt quickly and learn more new packages, have fun solving awesome, exhilarating and challenging problems, but the base of coding remains the same.
