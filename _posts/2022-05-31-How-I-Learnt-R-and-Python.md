Learning is a lifetime process. 

I heard somewhere in passing that Sanskrit language does not have a word for teaching. There is only a word for learning. This is intuitive too: you can't teach a person that doesn't want to learn and a person who wants to learn, will find any way. This is more true now more than ever, with a million resources available. Even so, we all have different styles of learning - some can read textbooks, while others listen and retain information, and some are visual learners. In my combined experience of attending some of the best educational institutes, self-learning and learning while at work, I have found that the best way to learn is to relate it to every day things: maybe this is why you learn more at work/projects than while attending classes. For example, differential calculus can be learnt through the examples such as of a runner when you want to know the runner's velocity in some exact moment as it may be different at different times. Visual learning is also very powerful to keep things in memory.
